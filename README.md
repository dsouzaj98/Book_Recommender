# Capstone 3 Proposal

I would like to create a book recommender that would accept a genre, author, title, or keyword to generate a set of recommendations for books to read.  I would use this dataset from kaggle to classify the data.  https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k?select=to_read.csv

My minimum viable product would be a working app that would be able to take in user inputs for various categories and return a selection of recommended books that the user would be interested in.  I would also like to include clustering in order to separate groups of books based on the target audience.  My MVP+ would be to include image processing and NLP for more detailed recommendations.
