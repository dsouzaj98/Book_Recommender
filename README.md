Book Recommender

Summary: 
This book recommender takes in an input of a list of books with their ratings for a particular user and returns a selection of books that the reader would enjoy.  If no previous ratings exist, it can also use a title of a single book to create the recommendations.  During this project, I was able to explore clustering user data and utilizing cosine similarity matrices in recommender systems.
